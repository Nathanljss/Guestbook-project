I really struggled with this project
I find HTML and CSS pretty simple but struggle with javaScript and even more when it comes to the API stuff and mixing in SQL as well

We have a webpage containing a form and a list for all previous messages (It does not function because for some reason my script just constantly gets flagged as undefined)

The webpage is viewable on smaller screens

There is an API POST and GET route connected to a database on Supabase but I couldnt get it to pull or push any information to or from the database even though the table is seeded

I couldnt get any messages to display on the page when entered or pulled from the API but submitted form data does appear in both the console log and server terminal (at least it did before the submit button broke)
